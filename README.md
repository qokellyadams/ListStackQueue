<h3>07.AT.R - Review Program</h3>
<p>Your program will ask the user for their name, age, favorite 3+ digit number, and GPA  (cumulative, weighted). The program will then print out a set of messages based on the following:  </p>
<ol>
  <li>The first line of output must include the name of the user and a welcome message.</li>
<li>The second line of output should tell the user either “Congratulations” for being 18 and  being able to vote or it should tell them how many more years they will have to wait until they  can vote.  </li>
<li>The third line of output should output to the user one of five different, school appropriate,  positive or motivating messages based on their cumulative GPA – the breakdown points are  4.5+, 4.0 – 4.49, 3.5 – 3.99, 3.0 – 3.49, and anything below a 3.0.  </li>
<li>The last output will be all the multiples of the length of the person’s name up to and possibly  including their favorite number. The multiples should be labeled and appear on a single line  with commas separating them. (If there are so many multiples that they go to an additional  line, that is ok.)  </li>
</ol>

  <p>The finished assignment is worth 30 points.For this and the final assignment - no grade sheet is being provided prior to the  assignment because this is a test of your knowledge of Java and the grade sheet would give away details about the assignment. But, here are some important reminders to think about when coding (these do not need to be included in the plan, just your final program):  </p>
<ul><li>Make sure that you include a comment block with your name, date, pd, name of the class, and  purpose of the class.  </li>
<li>Also make sure that you correctly import any necessary classes/packages and comment on why  you are importing them.  </li>
<li>Make sure that the program checks that the user’s input is legal (think carefully – what could  stupid users try to do?). </li> 
<li>Make sure that you use the correct variable types and that you clearly label all input and output. 
</li></ul>
